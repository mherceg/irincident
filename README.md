# irincident

A simple script that records all the incidents in an iRacing replay from multiple camera angles. 

Requirements: 
iRacing
pyirsdk (https://github.com/kutu/pyirsdk)
OBS or similar screen recorder

Usage instructions:
Open the replay
Open OBS or your recording software, set <Alt> + <F9> to be recording start & end or change the combo in the script to match your setup
Run the script, change active window to recording software, change active window to iRacing (You will have 10s to do that)
Don't touch anything while it's working

I know it's a mess and easily breaks. Beats recording all this stuff manually. 

All PRs welcome.
